<p><strong>Definition of a blog</strong></p>

<p> </p>

<p>Blogs are regularly updated websites that provide insight into a certain topic. The word blog is a combined version of the words “web” and “log.” At their inception, blogs were simply an online diary where people could keep a log about their daily lives on the web. They have since morphed into an essential forum for individuals and businesses alike to share information and updates. In fact, many people even<a href="https://www.wix.com/blog/2020/12/how-to-make-money-blogging" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"> make money blogging</a> as professional full-time bloggers.</p>

<p><strong>Types of blogs</strong></p>

<p> </p>

<p>Different<a href="https://www.wix.com/blog/2021/02/types-of-blogs/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"> types of blogs</a> cover varying topics, from food and fashion to marketing. Blogs are composed of individual posts on more specific subjects within the blog’s field of expertise. These posts often serve as a platform for discussions, as many blogs have active comments sections. You can think of a blog almost as a newspaper that adds articles and continually maintains the archive.</p>

<h3>Website vs blog</h3>

<p> </p>

<p>As you now know, a blog often deals with a given topic and is updated with regular posts, mostly in the form of articles. Websites, however, are often broken down into inner explanatory pages, each with varying purposes. This can mean anything from an FAQ page to a welcoming homepage design. These pages are occasionally updated, making a website more static than a blog. Oftentimes websites have internal blogs, while other websites are entirely blogs without any additional pages.</p>

<p> </p>

<p>When blogs are a section of a larger website, the website provides the bulk of the information and uses a blog feature to keep users updated and engaged. For example, think of an<a href="https://www.wix.com/ecommerce/online-store" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"> online store</a> that also offers a blog about their various products and how to use them.</p>

<p> </p>

<p>Blogs that make up the entire website usually rely on the content itself rather than sell a product or market a service.</p>

<h3>Importance of blogs</h3>

<p> </p>

<p>Whether it’s personal or professional, a blog provides endless opportunities for a website’s traffic growth. Not to mention, the popularity of blogs hasn&#39;t diminished. In fact, the opposite is true: As Neal Shaffer, founder of the digital marketing consultancy PDCA Social says, <a href="https://nealschaffer.com/is-blogging-dead/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">blogging isn’t dead</a>, “blogs are useful for a lot more than just sharing your thoughts. In fact, 60% of consumers will buy something after they’ve read a blog post on the topic.”</p>
