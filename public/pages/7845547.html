<h2><span style="font-size:18px">Data, information, knowledge, and wisdom</span></h2>

<p><span style="font-size:18px">With so much data being collected by organizations, it can be a challenge to know how to manage and analyze it properly. Enter data management systems and tools...</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:18px">Data management systems help organizations <strong>optimize </strong>the use of <strong>data</strong> to <a href="https://digitalmarketinginstitute.com/blog/how-to-use-data-analytics-to-drive-better-business-insights" target="_blank">make decisions and take actions</a> that will maximize the benefits to the organization. The systems do this by collecting, processing, securing, and storing data in a way that can be used for strategic decision-making. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:18px">This can be explained further by looking at the <strong>DIKW pyramid. </strong></span><br />
 </p>

<p><span style="font-size:18px"><img alt="The DIKW Pyramid" src="https://mydmi.imgix.net/M5_DataSystems_DIKW.png?fm=jpg&ixlib=php-3.3.1&q=40&w=652&s=ba51b3dc08ef26e675fdbfa4510fef66" style="height:372px; width:652px" /></span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:18px">The DIKW Pyramid</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:18px">The DIKW pyramid represents the relationship between <strong>data</strong>, <strong>information</strong>, <strong>knowledge</strong>, and <strong>wisdom</strong>. Each building block is a step towards answering different questions about data collection and adding value to it. You can answer questions like, where are my sales likely to come from next year or who are my top customers? The more data that can be enriched with meaning and context, the more knowledge and insights can be extracted.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:18px">What role does each of the steps play? Let&#39;s look at each of them in turn and then at the tools applicable to each. </span><br />
 </p>

<h3><span style="font-size:18px">Data</span></h3>

<p><span style="font-size:18px">This step on the pyramid refers to the collection of discreet facts about events in the form of numbers, characters, and specific or relative values that an organization can gather. Essentially, this is every piece of data that is being captured, known as <strong>raw data</strong>. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:18px">The key activities to be performed at this stage are:</span></p>

<ul>
	<li><span style="font-size:18px">Identifying a reliable source to get data</span></li>
	<li><span style="font-size:18px">Archiving and deleting irrelevant data</span><br />
	 </li>
</ul>

<h3><span style="font-size:18px">Information</span></h3>

<p><span style="font-size:18px">Once irrelevant data has been removed, the task is to seek out key pieces of information from the data. This information should be relevant to the organization, and its decision-making. </span></p>

<h3><span style="font-size:18px">Knowledge</span></h3>

<p><span style="font-size:18px">Using the key pieces of information from the data, you can then develop them into knowledge. In essence, this means deciding if the information can be developed into something of intellectual value and used to help formulate a robust strategy.</span></p>

<h3><span style="font-size:18px">Wisdom</span></h3>

<p><span style="font-size:18px">If something has been discovered in the data that competitors have yet to unearth, you could translate this knowledge into core insights. Organizations may formulate a whole strategy around these insights to create something magical. This is known as the wisdom step. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:18px">By applying the principles of the four building blocks of the DIKW pyramid to interpret raw data, you can convert the data into something very meaningful and insightful. </span><br />
 </p>

<h2><span style="font-size:18px">Data management tools</span></h2>

<p><span style="font-size:18px">Fortunately, there’s a range of management tools at an organization’s disposal to assist with interpreting raw data. Many of these tools can be used as cloud-based applications and services.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:18px">In a ’cloud’, for example, organizations can store information much more readily, files can be transferred quickly, and different datasets can be analyzed and translated across the world efficiently. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:18px">Once you’ve agreed on the data storage requirements and considerations, your organization next needs to consider how to analyze the datasets. Several companies provide data management services and tools for dealing with medium to large data sets. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:18px">These include:</span></p>

<ul>
	<li><span style="font-size:18px"><strong>Teradata </strong>is a company that provides three main services: business analytics, cloud products, and consulting. It handles large and mixed datasets and meshes them together to create meaningful insights.</span></li>
	<li><span style="font-size:18px"><strong>IBM </strong>automates end-to-end data management. Using artificial intelligence (AI) technology enables organizations to spot new patterns and trends to improve operations.</span></li>
	<li><span style="font-size:18px"><strong>Oracle </strong>is a multi-model relational database management system that provides grid computing and data warehousing.</span></li>
	<li><span style="font-size:18px"><strong>SAP </strong>provides multiple data management tools which help to ensure data quality, migration of data, text analysis, and interconnectivity of Big Data acquired from various sources. </span></li>
	<li><span style="font-size:18px"><strong>Cloudera HP </strong>enables enterprises to derive insights from Big Data by providing an infrastructure to store, manage, and process it. </span></li>
	<li><span style="font-size:18px"><strong>1010data</strong> combines market intelligence, data management, granular enterprise analytics, and collaboration capabilities.</span></li>
	<li><span style="font-size:18px"><strong>Amazon Web Services (AWS) </strong>provides servers, storage, networking, remote commuting, email, mobile development, and security.</span><br />
	 </li>
</ul>

<h2><span style="font-size:18px">Information management tools</span></h2>

<p><span style="font-size:18px">Information management is essentially the management of processed data to provide insights as an output; the group of data that collectively carries a specific logical meaning. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:18px">Here are some popular information management tools: </span></p>

<ul>
	<li><span style="font-size:18px"><strong>Evernote </strong>is a note-taking software that helps you create and organize digital notes, keeping them synced across all account holder’s devices. It also reminds you of upcoming or planned actions.</span></li>
	<li><span style="font-size:18px"><strong>Instapaper </strong>is a social bookmarking service that allows web content to be saved so it can be read at a later stage and on a different device. This saved content might later inspire you when you’re developing your digital strategy.</span></li>
	<li><span style="font-size:18px"><strong>Pinboard </strong>is an alternative social bookmarking tool, similar to Instapaper, but with a more basic layout.</span></li>
</ul>

<p><span style="font-size:18px">An information management framework can help you understand how these tools can be used most effectively. </span></p>

<h3><strong><span style="font-size:20px">Source</span></strong></h3>

<p><span style="font-size:20px">The data source might be internal or external. </span></p>

<ul>
	<li><span style="font-size:20px">An organization will have internal data that it has collected about its customers, such as product files, sales figures, financial information. This can then be translated into valuable insights. </span></li>
	<li><span style="font-size:20px">It will also have external sources of data, such as GPS positioning, journals, social web, and postcodes. </span><br />
	 </li>
</ul>

<h3><strong><span style="font-size:20px">Structure</span></strong></h3>

<p><span style="font-size:20px">Once the sources of data, both internal and external, have been considered, you have to to work out how they are structured. What information can be gleaned from both internal and external sources of structured and unstructured data?</span></p>

<ul>
	<li><span style="font-size:20px">Structured data is data that has been organized, so that its elements can be effectively processed and analyzed. An example of strutcured data would be a list of your top 10 customers from hundreds of customer profiles from your ecommerce store</span></li>
	<li><span style="font-size:20px">Unstructured data is data that is not stored in an organized format. Unstructured data is typically text-heavy, but may contain data such as dates, numbers, and facts as well.</span></li>
</ul>

<p><span style="font-size:20px">Information management tools can store both structured and unstructured data and assist in the process of managing the complete lifecycle of information, from its identification and collection, to its disposal through archiving or deletion. They can encompass all physical and electronic data collected by a business from its customers, employees, and vendors. </span></p>
